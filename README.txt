you need use mysql
first:excute ColumnTypes.sql
second:modify config.properties file mysql configuration
third:modify MysqlDBHelper.java's main function,productXML("ColumnTypes",true);
     "ColumnTypes" is table name,"true" the object attribute is "userName" ,"false" is "username"
forth:you can copy controle content,it's so simple,or find the "mybait.xml" in the project "bin"
      directory
